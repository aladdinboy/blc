		<h1>Shy Twink Kyle</h1>
		<div>
			<p>You first meet Kyle at this year's pride parade. He's hiding, from both the sun and the sweaty, <span>musky</span> crowd, under a rainbow flag. He apparently came with a friend of his, who you knew from high school. The mutual friend is crunching into a crisp <span>apple</span>, waiting for the parade to officially start.</p>
			<p>"Hey, you made it! Have you met my friend Kyle? We're both on the swim team," the friend says, nodding at the figure half-hidden under the rainbow flag.</p>
			<p>"No, I don't think so," you shout, over the roar as the parade lurches into motion. You introduce yourself to Kyle, and he releases one of the corners of the flag to shake your hand. He gives you a shy smile which lights up his face, from his cute brown eyes to his <span>cherry</span>-red blush.</p>
			<p>With the pride flag not obscuring him completely, you take in the rest of his slim figure. Despite the heat, he's wearing a long-sleeve shirt with a picture of a <span>cucumber</span> and the words "I'm a cute-cumber" underneath. The scent of his <span>off-brand cologne</span> surrounds you, and you briefly forget about the parade and the crowd and heat and your promise to your roommate to make dinner.</p>
			<p>"H-hey," Kyle mutters, barely audible over the crowd. "This really isn't my scene. I'm just here with my friend. B-but, maybe, after the parade, we could get some coffee? If you're interested?"</p>
			<p>You grin and nod. "Yeah, I'd like that. Somewhere quieter and less crowdedâ€¦ I know just the place."</p>
			<p>The mutual friend rolls his eyes.</p>
