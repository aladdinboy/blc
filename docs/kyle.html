		<h1>Shy Twink Kyle</h1>
		<div>
			<p>Kyle wasn't easy to find at the pride parade. You only knew him through a mutual friend, but you'd heard all about him. About his shy but straightforward demeanor, his boyish charm, and his adorable platinum blonde hair.</p>
<p>Eventually, you find your friend, and beside him, peeking out from underneath a rainbow pride flag, is Kyle. Your friend's description of him didn't do him justice. From his <em>cherry</em>-red blush to the brilliant blue of his eyes, he is pure twink. He hides partly behind the flag as your friend introduces the two of you.</p>
<p>"Hi," you say, shaking his hand as his <em>musk</em> and <em>off-brand cologne</em> waft out from under the flag. He smells delicious, and you know that, if you're not already, you'll be smitten by the end of the day. Kyle gives you a shy grin, and lowers the flag so it drapes across his shoulders like a cape. You can now see that he's wearing a somewhat tight-fitting tee shirt with a <em>cucumber</em> on it, captioned with "I'm a cute-cumber."</p>
<p>"You know, I totally forgot to grab a snack before I left," you say, talking barely loud enough to be heard over the sound of the parade beginning to move. "After the parade, I was going to swing by Parry's, maybe grab an <em>apple</em>. Would you like to join me? We can get something to cool off."</p>
<p>Kyle beams and nods. "I'd like that. I'd like that a lot."</p>
