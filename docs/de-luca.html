		<h1>Bisexual Professor De Luca</h1>
		<div>
			<p>The first time you see Professor Marco De Luca, he is speaking at a symposium at the university. You graduated a few years ago, but always enjoy visiting campus to hear the world renowned speakers they had. Not only is De Luca brilliant — you've read both of his books on the history and evolution of societal influences and pressures on non-heteronormative romantic partnerships — but he is just dashing in his corduroy sports coat and signature black turtleneck. After his presentation finishes, you follow him out into the commons, where you introduce yourself and ask if he would sign your copy of his books.</p>
<p>"You enjoyed them?" He asks, shuffling around his <em>paper</em> notes from his talk.</p>
<p>You nod. "They're brilliant. Although I disagree with your conclusion about the influence of internet culture with regards to public perception of bisexuality."</p>
<p>He laughs as he pulls out his <em>tobacco pipe</em> — the same one that's featured in all of his author photos. "You're not the first. I debated whether or not to even include that section. Being bisexual myself, it's difficult to be purely objective and ignore anecdotal evidence, even when I'm the primary source of the anecdote." He doesn't light his pipe, as smoking is forbidden on campus, but he bites the end nonetheless. "You know, I don't come down to this campus very often. Where's a good place to get a bite to eat?"</p>
<p>You grin. "There's a coffee shop two blocks from here that has salads, sandwiches, and amazing <em>vanilla</em> bean scones. If you don't mind the company, I'd be happy to buy you a light lunch."</p>
<p>He hands you your book, now emblazoned with his signature and, you hope, infused with a hint of his alluring <em>musk</em>. "It would be my honor."</p>
