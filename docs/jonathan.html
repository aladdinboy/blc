		<h1>Perky Otter Jonathan</h1>
		<div>
			<p>You only knew Jonathan through your local gym. He was a Tuesdays and Fridays regular, and always very friendly. You had chatted with him a fair amount, often when switching from cardio to resistance training. But nothing beyond that casual chat. So it came as a surprise to you when he invited you over to his place one evening.</p>
			<p>"Are you sure?" You had asked. "I'd hate to impose."</p>
			<p>He chuckled, wiping a drop of <em>musky</em> sweat from his ginger-brown beard. "Not at all. My <em>rosemary</em> bush in my back yard has had a growth spurt, so I've been looking for excuses to fire up the barbecue and grill up some rosemary flank steak."</p>
			<p>So here you are now, in front of Jonathan's modest flat in the suburbs. He greets you at the door, perky and beaming and dressed in a soft plaid flannel shirt. The <em>night air</em> is, after all, a little nippy.</p>
			<p>He guides you through his house, and you get impressions of rich <em>black oak</em> and the lingering scent of <em>cloves</em>, but before you can investigate any further, you find yourself on his back patio, lit with soft warm fairy lights and a couple candles. The grill is already sizzling, and Jonathan offers you a slice of buttered <em>currant</em> bread while you wait.</p>
			<p>"You know, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to woo me," you mutter, sitting down and taking the offered glass of wine.</p>
			<p>"Maybe I am. Is it working?" He asks, a sparkle of mischief in his eyes.</p>
			<p>You grin back. "I think it just might be."</p>
