		<h1>Flirty Barista Armando</h1>
		<div>
			<p>Amidst swirling, billowing clouds of <em>chai latte</em> scented steam, you see him. Armando. The hunky, dark-skinned barista at your local coffee shop. A caffeine craftsman. With a wink and a nod and a dash of <em>syrup</em>, he seems to magically conjure whatever drink your heart desires, all while keeping his dark brown eyes trained on you. During his breaks, you see him curled up in one of the caf√©'s overstuffed armchairs, sometimes sipping a <em>vanilla bean</em> iced drink, and always reading a trendy book. You long to curl up beside him, bathe in his <em>musk</em> and charm and lightning-fast wit.</p>
			<p>Last week, you did your best to be coy and casually mention your desire for a date to the pride fest. This week, Armando blushes ever so slightly as he hands you your <em>blueberry muffin</em>, steaming drink, and receipt. You glance down at the small strip of paper. Written in red is his phone number, along with the words 'call me'. You glance back up at him.</p>
			<p>"Later," he mouths, and winks.</p>
